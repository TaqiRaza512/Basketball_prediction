## 🚀 Project Summary

* I analyzed basketball player data.
* Built models to predict player "Target" (success).
* Used clustering to find player groups.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

1.  **Data Exploration:**
    * Loaded data, checked for missing values, and visualized feature relationships.
2.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Cleaned and prepared data for modeling.
    * Handled missing values and removed highly correlated features.
    * Scaled the data.
3.  **Prediction:**
    * Trained machine learning models to predict player success.
    * Logistic Regression performed best.
4.  **Clustering:**
    * Used PCA for dimensionality reduction.
    * Applied K-Means to group players.
    * Visualized player clusters.

## 📊 Key Results

* **Prediction:** Logistic Regression showed the highest accuracy.
* **Clustering:** Players were grouped into distinct performance clusters.
* **Correlations:** Observed strong correlations between related player statistics.

## 💻 Tech Used

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
